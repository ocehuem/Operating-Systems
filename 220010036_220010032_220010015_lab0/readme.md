Developed a C/C++ image processing application that sharpens images in PPM format by implementing smoothing, detail extraction, and sharpening transformations. Utilized Makefile for automated build and run processes, with debugging handled using gdb and IDE tools. Conducted performance analysis using C++ chrono library, measuring execution time across different image sizes and phases (read, S1, S2, S3, write). Automated experiments through scripting and documented results in a detailed report.
