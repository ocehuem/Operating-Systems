## 2.Working with processes

Implemented a process-based file search application in C++, focusing on process creation, execution, and termination using fork, exec, and wait. 
Designed a partitioned search mechanism where parent processes divide files into chunks and spawn child processes for parallel pattern searching. 
Enhanced efficiency by implementing signal handling to terminate redundant processes once a match is found. Developed multiple versions (Part Iâ€“III) of searcher and partitioner programs, integrating inter-process communication and process tree management. 
Automated compilation and execution with a structured Makefile. 
Documented process hierarchies, execution flow, and termination sequences with detailed reports and visualized process trees.
